## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in ghx, please report it responsibly.

**Preferred method:** Open a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/aryeko/ghx/security/advisories/new) (private by default).

**Alternative:** If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/aryeko/ghx/issues) tagged `security`. Include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide an initial assessment. We aim to address critical issues as quickly as possible.

## Disclosure

- We will not disclose the issue publicly until a fix is available or a mutually agreed timeline has passed.
- We will credit you in the advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
- We follow a coordinated disclosure process aligned with [GitHub's guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/about-coordinated-disclosure-of-security-vulnerabilities).
