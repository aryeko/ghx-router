  - **Role**: primary execution plan for repo development.
  - **Use for**: implementation order, phase goals, and exit criteria.

## Active Sub-Plan

- `2026-02-13-benchmark-harness-ts-sdk-design.md`
  - **Role**: implementation spec for Phase 2.5 and benchmark system design.
  - **Use for**: benchmark runner architecture, metrics schema, and reliability controls.

## Reference Plans

- `2026-02-13-ghx-router-architecture.md`
  - **Role**: architecture baseline and component model.
  - **Use for**: system boundaries and design rationale.

- `2026-02-13-efficiency-evaluation.md`
  - **Role**: measurement policy and validation thresholds.
  - **Use for**: benchmark success criteria and reporting gates.

## How To Work

1. Execute work according to the phased plan.
2. When implementing Phase 2.5, follow the benchmark TS SDK design doc.
3. Validate outcomes using the efficiency evaluation thresholds.
4. Update this index if active plan ownership changes.
