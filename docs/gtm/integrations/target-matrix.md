2. `microsoft/autogen`
3. `crewAIInc/crewAI`
4. `pydantic/pydantic-ai`
5. `huggingface/smolagents`

## Selection Rationale
1. Active agent-builder audiences.
2. Existing workflows where GitHub automation examples are relevant.
3. High leverage for installed-user conversions through trusted ecosystems.

## PR Packet Standard
Each packet must include:
1. Maintainer fit rationale.
2. Exact files and paths likely to change.
3. Minimal runnable example.
4. PR title and body template.
5. Benchmark placeholder policy note.
6. Rejection fallback plan.
