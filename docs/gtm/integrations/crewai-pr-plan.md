# CrewAI PR Plan

## Maintainer Fit Rationale
CrewAI teams need practical task execution components; a stable GitHub capability layer is a concrete operational fit.

## Likely Files and Paths
1. `docs/` section for tools and integrations.
2. `examples/` for crew task execution with external tools.
3. Optional templates or recipes for issue/PR workflows.

## Minimal Example
Add a task tool wrapper showing a crew invoking `ghx` for `repo.view` and one PR-related read capability.

## PR Title Template
`docs(tools): add ghx GitHub automation example for CrewAI tasks`

## PR Body Template
1. Motivation and user value.
2. Short integration code sample.
3. Setup commands and expected output.
4. Non-invasive scope and placeholder claim policy.

## Benchmark Placeholder Note
Use placeholders for any performance line until final snapshot import.

## Rejection Fallback
Publish CrewAI-specific integration guide in `ghx` docs and share as external recipe.
