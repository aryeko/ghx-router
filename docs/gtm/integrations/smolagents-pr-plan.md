# smolagents PR Plan

## Maintainer Fit Rationale
smolagents users value compact, practical workflows; a lightweight `ghx` command path demonstrates immediate utility.

## Likely Files and Paths
1. `docs/` tool usage examples.
2. `examples/` scripts for external tool execution.
3. Optional README references to ecosystem integrations.

## Minimal Example
Add a concise script where an agent calls `ghx capabilities list` then `ghx run repo.view` and parses normalized output.

## PR Title Template
`examples: add minimal ghx GitHub execution recipe for smolagents`

## PR Body Template
1. Short motivation statement.
2. Minimal code and run steps.
3. Expected outputs.
4. Placeholder policy for benchmark claims.

## Benchmark Placeholder Note
No numeric claim until snapshot values are finalized and imported.

## Rejection Fallback
Keep recipe as standalone `ghx` example and share through community channels.
