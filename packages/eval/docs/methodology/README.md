# Methodology

This section explains what eval measures, why those measurements matter, and how to interpret results as evidence for or against the ghx hypothesis.

## Pages

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Thesis](./thesis.md) | The claim ghx makes and how eval tests it |
| [Evaluation Design](./evaluation-design.md) | Why three modes, why repetitions, what makes a fair comparison |
| [Metrics](./metrics.md) | Every metric collected, what it measures, and why it matters |
| [Interpreting Results](./interpreting-results.md) | How to read eval reports as evidence -- statistical methods explained |

## Where to Start

Start with [Thesis](./thesis.md) to understand the claim eval is designed to test. Then read [Evaluation Design](./evaluation-design.md) to understand how the three-mode comparison produces fair, repeatable evidence.
