# Branding Assets

This directory stores release-facing brand assets for `ghx`.

## Direction Lock (2026-02-14)

- Locked identity direction: Grid + Arrow (geometric routing mark)
- Brand goal: state-of-the-art OSS infrastructure identity optimized for trust and adoption
- Canonical logo reference: `logos/ghx-logo-icon.svg`
- Canonical social reference: `social/ghx-social-dark-1280x640.png`

## Structure

- `BRAND_BRIEF.md` - locked brand strategy, constraints, and visual rules
- `logos/` - canonical logo exports (flat, no glow)
- `social/` - Open Graph/social cards (`1280x640`)
- `favicons/` - favicon/app icon exports (`16`, `32`, `180`)
- `ASSET_TARGETS.md` - required final filenames and export specs

## Final Asset Guidelines

- Keep canonical logo assets flat and clean (no glow/blur baked into logos)
- Reserve glow/atmosphere effects for social cards only
- Ensure lockup text remains high-contrast on both dark and light backgrounds
- Export logos with transparent backgrounds
- Prioritize small-size legibility over decorative complexity
